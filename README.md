Group Mates Kyle Du, James Parrott, Logan Dinh 

The project is called CarQueen. Users on the website can interact with a list of cars. The users can read the car's price, mileage, safety, and other specifications. Users on the website can upload vehicles to the site and compare the specifications of any two cars side by side.

The functionality that CarQueen possesses will be a search feature for the home page. It will allow a user to search for a specific card and it will display that car's more info page. Additionally the user can use the clear function and clear the search bar. The home page is not sorted and new cars are added to the bottom of the page.

Another functionality CarQueen possesses is that a user can compare two cars stored within the database. On the compare page, a user can filter by car categories and select two cars. Each car card will display some information for the user to see and compare.

The final functionality CarQueen possesses is an upload feature. A user can upload any car they want to the database so that they can compare it to any car already cataloged. They can upload an assortment of facts and figures to help a user better understand their car.
