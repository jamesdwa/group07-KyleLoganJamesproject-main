        <h1>Project Requirements</h1>

        <div>
            <h2>Question 1</h2>
            <p>The overview of our project is cars and finding cars. We want to help people find cars and search for cars that they want to purchase. Normally a person would have to go to a car dealership to choose a car. But we want to make a web-app where a user can learn more about different cars, their prices and attributes. This can help a user determine which car to buy and the price they should expect.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Question 2</h2>
            <p>The current information technology problem is that car purchasing and the dealer experience is very intimidating because oftentimes users are going into a dealership that sells one particular brand of car. We want to provide users with as many options that users can choose from that meets their needs and provides general information on what the vehicle is. Allowing users to worry about psychological factors of a dealer is what we hope to accomplish. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Question 3</h2>
            <p>The websites tend to be laggy and not user friendly. We want to make a website convenient and compatible for users of all backgrounds and make car shopping easy. We want to create an efficient website that the users scroll through easily. We also want to ensure that users have the ability to filter cars based on their desires. Our website should be more personalized compared to other car-searching websites by allowing the users to customize their search/filtering options.</p>

        <h1>App Description</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Question 1</h2>
            <p>The users of our apps is a future car-buyer. Anyone who wants to shop for a car or upgrade their car can use this website to help determine their next vehicle. This web-app can also be used by anyone to learn more about cars and their features. Our websites goal is to help someone learn more about cars and the process of buying cars. This app might help minorities learn more about the car-buying process and help them have better car transactions. This app might help minority groups understand their car prices and how much they should expect to pay. We’ll have alt tags to increase accessibility for users with various abilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Question 2</h2>
            <p>The features that we want to implement in our car search web page is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Searching / filtering for a specific car attribute such as economic car, sports car, etc.</li>
                <li>Upload a new car that users want to see in the web page for potential comparison. Users need to specify descriptions of the car.</li>
                <li>Comparing two or more vehicles based on user preference to compare what vehicles they see best fit for their user case (such as comparing a Honda Civic to a Toyota Prius).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Question 3</h2>
            <p>We'll use Firebase to store the images that the users will upload. We'll use a<a href=https://github.com/ShuklaPrashant21/Used-Car-Price-Prediction/blob/master/car%20data.csv> CSV file</a> from GitHub by user <cite>huklaPrashant21</cite> for the information about the cars.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Question 4</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to have this app display car information in a clear and concise manner. This aims to help people better understand car information and car pricing models. Then with this knowledge, people will have a better understanding about their price. It will help people improve their bargaining at dealerships. Our app can also help a person understand their cars value and they can use that information to bargain for a better trade-in value. Our app will improve people’s experiences at car dealerships.</p>
